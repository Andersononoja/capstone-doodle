    "### Chicago Crime Data - INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Officially the City of Chicago, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois, and the third-most-populous city in the United States. With an estimated population of 2,705,994 (2018), it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States. Chicago is the county seat of Cook County, the second-most-populous county in the US, with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport. Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland. At nearly 10 million people, the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States.\n",
    "In this project I will be looking at the crime data of the city of chicago with some modifications gotten from the website of the city of Chicago\n",
    "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. \n",

    "## PROBLEM AND DESCRIPTION\n",
    "Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts, issued by the Chicago Board of Trade, which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world, generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone.Depending on the particular year, the city's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International.The region also has the largest number of federal highways and is the nation's railroad hub. Chicago was listed as an alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and it ranked seventh in the entire world in the 2017 Global Cities Index.[16] The Chicago area has one of the highest gross domestic products (GDP) in the world, generating $689 billion in 2018.[17] In addition, the city has one of the world's most diversified and balanced economies, with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce.[18] Chicago is home to several Fortune 500 companies, including Allstate, Boeing, Caterpillar, Exelon, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Mondelez International, Sears, United Airlines Holdings, US Foods, and Walgreens.\n",
    "Thus with Chicago being the second most viisted city in the US, there is bound to be 'bad elements' who orchestrate or carry out criminal activities on unsuspecting citizens but the city of chicago is large with 25 named districts. To this end, I seek to find out among the districts the places or neighborhoods with high crime rate, comparing it across different venues to inform the public, especially tourists or visitors about areas they should be security conscious of and also to enlighten the police department about these high risk neighborhoods and the specific type of crime involved in those areas which will help them determine policing methods that will ensure the safety of the public and increase public confidence."
